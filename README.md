# Learning Data Analytics

I recently signed up for a data anlytics course (using Python) on Dataquest.

I'll be using this repository to manage all of my Jupyter notebooks.

## Projects

### Completed:

#### Popular Apps Genre for Google and Apple Stores
The goal is to analyze two datasets (one for each app store) to help a mobile app agency decide which category they should build their next app in. My approach to this is documented in [this Jupyter notebook](profitable-app-profiles.ipynb).

#### Exploring Hacker News
The goal is to analyze a dataset of Hacker News posts to identify the best times to post to maximize engagement (measured by upvotes and comments). My approach to this is documented in [this Jupyter notebook](exploring-hacker-news.ipynb).

### Working files:

#### Analyzing eBay Car Sales
The goal of this exercise is to clean a dataset of eBay car sales, practicing using Pandas dataframes. My working file is stored in [this Jupyter notebook](ebay-car-sales.ipynb).
