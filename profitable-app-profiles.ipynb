    "The goal of this project is to identify the most profitable app profiles in the store. This should help our agency identify where we should focus our development effort. In order to ensure only relevant data is analyzed, the characteristics of the agency need to be kept in mind:\n",
    "* Only builds free apps (no paid apps)\n",
    "* Only builds apps for the English-speaking world (no foreign-language apps)\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, I wouldn't want to exclude data outside of this profile (as I may find that those excluded categories / formats are actually the most lucrative) but for the purposes of this exercise I'll take those constraints for granted."

It has the same fields available in the provided Android dataset, so I'm going to also include this in the analysis. The larger dataset should allow for more granular insights into the Android market. Unfortunately, a similar larger dataset couldn't be found for the Apple app store."
